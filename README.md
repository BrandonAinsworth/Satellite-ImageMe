## Project Overview
Satellite-ImageMe is an educational application designed to demonstrate and bolster interest satellite technology. The ImageMe feature allows a user to input a date, click a button, and receive a satellite image of their location from the NASA Open Earth API which provides images from Landsat 8. A user can save their favorite photos, and also visit the Astronomy Photo of the Day, another NASA API. Here the user can see today's image, or input a date and see any photo's of the day from past times with supporting information, all with the ability to save these images as well! The user can also visit the about page, and learn about how ImageMe works and how imaging satellites work.



## Learning Goals
This project is a part of Turing School of Software and Design's [Showcase Project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

* Explore third-party API's
* Manipulate API data
* Use React Hooks instead of Class Components
* Use Router and conditional rendering to navigate the application seamlessy
* Implement error handling

## Technologies and Tools


* JavaScript
* React
* React Router
* React Hooks
* JSX
* HTML
* CSS
* Fetch API
* Cypress
* Heroku
* NPM
* Webpack
* Figma


## Roadmap
Future features could include:
* Allow a user to use ImageMe on multiple locations
* Give a user more details about saved photos
* Allow a user to delete saved photos
* Responsiveness on multiple devices
* Implement more API's from NASA, Planet and more to continue interacting with satellite data

## Setup
1. _Fork_ and clone down this repository.
2. `cd` into the root directory and install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. To run the server, use command `npm start` in the terminal. To stop the local server, use command `Control + C`. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.
4. Running `npm start` should direct you to the application, but you can always access the website by visiting http://localhost:3000/.
